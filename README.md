### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I recently graduated from the University of Vermont with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Business. Currently, Iâ€™m working as a Software Engineer Intern at a startup, where Iâ€™m gaining hands-on experience with digital signal processing, modeling natural events, and helping to build a detailed codebase from the ground up. In addition, I serve as an assistant coach with the Lawrence Debate Union, where I continue to develop my leadership and communication skills.

My technical skill set includes Python, Java, C++, C, HTML, and JavaScript. I'm passionate about coding and am actively working on various projects that I plan to showcase here on GitHub. While my repository is growing, feel free to explore my work or reach out if you have any questions about my skills or projects.

Iâ€™m actively seeking opportunities in software development or software sales. Based in Burlington, VT, Iâ€™m excited to bring my technical expertise and enthusiasm to a dynamic team.
