### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Julian and I am a student at the University of Vermont studying Computer Science, with a minor in business. I am also the treasurer of the Lawrence Debate Team here at UVM. I am proficient in Python, Java, C++, C, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I'm slowly putting more of my projects on GitHub so eventually you will be able to see examples of that, but for now if you have any specific questions about what I can do, please don't hesitate to reach out!

I'm currently looking for an internship for the summer of 2023. I'm located in Burlington, VT.
